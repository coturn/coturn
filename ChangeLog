Version 4.5.1.0 'dan Eider':
	Consider to change config file after upgrade, because it contains some 
	not backward compatible breaking changes !!
	- Security fixes 
	  Many thanks to Nicolas Edet (Cisco) !!
	  who reported all of the following issues:
		* DB/SQL injection in stun realm. Fix: add extra string validation.
		* DB/SQL injection in web-admin interface lack of admin user validation. 
		  Fix: add extra string validation.
	 	* Fix for earlier unsafe default settings: 
			o HTTPS administrator interface should be disabled by default
			  It could be enbled with "web-admin" option.
			o Default configuration allowed earlier forwarding traffic 
			  from an external interface to loopback interface. Now it
			  has been changed and option name is also changed!

			  !!BREAKING change!! Don't forget to change config!!
			  "no-loopback-peers" replaced by "allow-loopback-peers"

			o Unauthenticated telnet admin interface runs on the 
			  loopback interface, which can be accessed by exploiting the
			  loopback relay that was enabled by default.
		*  Add username string sanity check on web admin interface to
		   avoid any sql-injection attacks.
	- Admin portal does not list TCP session ( reported and fixed by Nicolas Edet )
	- Fix memory leak in read_config_file (by Thibaut Ackermann)
	- Add a release helper script.
	- Web Admin interface use own listener (it is disableb by default) (by Thibaut ACKERMANN)

	  !!BREAKING change!! Don't forget to change/review config!!

		* Add new option "web-admin-ip" to set listener ip. By default (127.0.0.1)
		* Add new option "web-admin-port" to set webadmin listen port
		* Add new option "web-admin-listen-on-workers" to change back to earlier 
		  behaviour and listen web admin on all worker processes and ports.
	- Not allow to start server if "allow-loopback-peers" set without "cli-password"

	  !!BREAKING change!! Don't forget to change config!!

	  Added a warning if cli-password is empty or missing, but allow-loopback-peers
	  set, and so loopback allocation is enalbed.
