**Warning**: this chart is currently considered beta. Use at your own risk!

This chart deploys Wire's fork of [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn),
a STUN and TURN server, with some additional features developed by Wire (see
[here](https://github.com/wireapp/coturn/tree/wireapp)) to support our calling
services.

You need to supply a list of one or more zrest secrets at the key
`secrets.zrestSecrets`. The secret provided to the brig chart in
`secrets.turn.secret` must be included in this list.

Note that coturn pods are deployed with `hostNetwork: true`, as they need to
listen on a wide range of UDP ports. Additionally, some TCP ports need to be
exposed on the hosting node, which are listed in `values.yaml`.

Due to the nature of TURN, this service might also expose the
internal network to which the hosting node is connected. It is
therefore recommended to run coturn on a separate Kubernetes cluster
from the rest of the Wire services. Further details may be found in
Wire's documentation for Restund, another TURN implementation, on
[this](https://docs.wire.com/understand/restund.html#network) page.

coturn can optionally be configured to expose a TLS control port. The TLS
private key and certificates should be provided in a `Secret` whose name is
given in `tls.secretRef`.
