Description: TURN and STUN server for VoIP
 STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays
 around NAT) are protocols that can be used to provide NAT traversal for VoIP
 and WebRTC. This package provides a VoIP media traffic NAT traversal server
 and gateway.
 .
 Supported RFCs:
 TURN specs:
  * RFC 5766 - base TURN specs;
  * RFC 6062 - TCP relaying TURN extension;
  * RFC 6156 - IPv6 extension for TURN;
  * RFC 7635 - OAuth third-party TURN/STUN authorization;
  * DTLS support as client protocol

  * RFC 5769 - test vectors for STUN protocol testing;
  * RFC 5780 - NAT behavior discovery support.
 .
 The implementation fully supports UDP, TCP, TLS, and DTLS as protocols between
 the TURN client and the TURN server. Both UDP and TCP relaying are supported.
 .
 SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis are supported for the user
 repository (if authentication is required).
 The long-term credentials mechanism is supported.
 For WebRTC applications,
 the TURN server REST API for time-limited
 secret-based authentication is implemented.
 The third-party authentication
 specs (OAuth-based) are supported, too.
 .
 Load balancing can be implemented either by DNS round-robin mechanism, or with
 the external networking tools, or by
 the built-in ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism.
 .
 The implementation is intended to be simple to install and configure.
 The project focuses on performance, scalability, and simplicity.
 The aim is to provide an enterprise-grade TURN solution.
